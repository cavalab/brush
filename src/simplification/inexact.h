// needs the ss and the data to be passed

// simplification maps are based on trainingdata and return type of the node we are looking

// works with the tree prediction

// global dictionary (like the random state)

// should ignore fixed nodes ---> does not change subtrees if they contain fixed nodes

// number of tables and max_samples_to_use are parameters

// program, ss and dataset as parameters
