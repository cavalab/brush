# Parts of Brush

Brush mostly consists of these components: 

- A dataset class that handles multiple types of data
- A program class that defines composable operations over data
- A search space that samples the components of programs
- Tweaking operators to change programs randomly
- Optimizers to learn optimal splitting thresholds and optimal parameter values within programs.
