# brush

Brush is a strongly-typed genetic programming language. 
It is designed to allow **b**ackpropagations and **r**ecursion **u**sing **s**earch **h**euristics.

Goals:

- flexibility to define n-ary trees of operators on data of variable types (singletons, arrays, matrices of floats, ints, and bools)
- support for gradient descent over these programs
- support for recursive splits 
- fast-ish in C++
- easy-to-use Python API
